# Relentless

Relentless ​is a co-op multiplayer game for a maximum of 6 players that runs across multiple iOS devices over the network. In the game, players form a team of delivery workers working for a multinational conglomerate. This company delivers its products very quickly but its workers, namely the players, are overworked and mistreated. Each player has to work with his team to satisfy their customers, which will help them earn commission and feed their family. Their jobs are to pack items into packages based on their customers’ orders and deliver the packages to their respective houses.

However, each player will receive different orders in their neighbourhoods on their own devices. To complete an order, their own items in the warehouse are not enough. Each player will need to ask around to find out who has the extra required items and send a partially completed package to that person. Then, he/she will pack the required items into the package and send it back. After which, the player will send the completed package to the correct house.

There will be different types of items, such as books, magazines, robots and toy cars. Some of these items are designed to be hard to describe. For example, the title of a book or magazine to be delivered can be “the title of a book”, words that are difficult to pronounce, or homophones. Describing pictures can also be difficult because different pictures may have similar components. There are also rhythmic items that alternate their states according to a pattern, and items assembled from other items. As players cannot see one another’s orders, the game requires players to describe their orders clearly and concisely in order to last longer in the game.

The team’s customers’ satisfaction level increases according to the accuracy and speed of package deliveries. Hence, it increases if players send a package correctly and quickly but drops if the package is incorrect or they take too long to deliver the package.

At the end of each round, players will be able to see their collective amount of money based on their customers’ satisfaction level in the form of commision. At the same time, money will be deducted to pay for daily expenses. Players have to make sure that they do not run out of money to survive by working harder in the next round. This game promotes teamwork and encourages players to cooperate with their friends, whilst allowing them to experience the adrenaline arising from panic and chaos!
